```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

What about higher MAF sites?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
mafs<-read_tsv("outputs/104/mafs.txt", col_names = c("CHROM","POS","ID","REF","ALT","QUAL","FILTER","INFO")) %>% separate(INFO, sep=";", into = c("PR","MAF")) %>% select(-QUAL, -FILTER, PR)

mafs$MAF<-gsub("MAF=","",mafs$MAF)
mafs
```

Presumably, these SNPs are linked on the same locus and are similarly variable.

```{r}
mafs %>% group_by(CHROM) %>% mutate(Count=n()) %>% filter(Count > 1)
```


Atr_29414-61 varies a lot in MAF
